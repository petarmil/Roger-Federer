			<h1>Rivalries</h1>
			<h2>Federer vs. Nadal</h2>
			<p>Federer and Rafael Nadal have played 39 times, with Federer trailing 15–24. Federer has a winning record on grass 2–1 and hard courts 11–9, while Nadal leads on clay 14–2.[193] Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record nine Grand Slam finals.[194] Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004, and their rivalry is a significant part of both men's careers.[195][196][197][198][199] The latest encounter was at the 2019 French Open, where Nadal beat Federer in straight sets to reach the final.</p>
			<p>They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 17 August 2009, when Nadal fell to No. 3 (Andy Murray became the new No. 2),[200] and again from 11 September 2017 until 15 October 2018 (Novak Djokovic became the new No. 2). They are the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is five years younger, ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for 160 consecutive weeks, before surpassing Federer in August 2008.[201]</p>
			<h2>Federer vs. Djokovic</h2>
			<p>Federer and Novak Djokovic have played 47 times, with Federer trailing 22–25.[206][207] They are tied 4–4 on clay while Federer trails 17–19 on hard-courts and 1–2 on grass. The Federer–Djokovic rivalry is the largest rivalry in men's Grand Slam tournament history with a record 15 matches played against each other. Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open, also 2015 Wimbledon, US Open and 2016 Australian Open), and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic is one of two players (the other again being Nadal) on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Grand Slam event multiple times (2008 Australian Open, 2011 Australian Open, 2012 French Open) and the only player to do so three times. Of their 47 meetings, 18 have reached a deciding set.</p>
